For this week I am glad i started to get the hang of things and navigating through 
github, microsfot teams, etc. I was able to post and create a content file and I got the
hang of it fast. I also Thought  I took away managing content form moduel 2 and I am starting to
get really comfortable with that as well. Excited to learn so much more and bulid with my team.
