This week, I focused on the statements “I can manage content using established workflows” and “I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

Both within my group project and the Real Work this week, I started using the task function of Teams to assign myself work and break the larger projects into more manageable chunks.
I also realized that I had all the content I needed on the “Contact Us” page I have been working on and created new tasks to focus on fixing its presentation. 
Tasks have also helped me break up the group work, with my focus being on the Current Talent page and the child pages that will contain information about the fake artists.
Starting to use workflows more has helped break down the higher-level concept of the radio station and I have a better idea of what I will be working on.

In terms of self-directed learning, with the help of breakthroughs on Friday and experimenting outside of class beforehand, I have finally started really learning how to use WordPress and its features in ways that make my life easier.
The theme we are using for our Radio Station contains templates, and I am both doing hands on work and reading how-to pages to move my work forward.

Overall, this has been a very encouraging week for me. I have a better sense of direction for these projects and feel a little more confident in my ability to execute my part of them.
