For team 4, this week we’ve started getting everyone back on the same page and addressing some the technology issues that were hindering communication. 
We realized that Craig had been added to our private Teams with a different email, so we got that sorted out and now he is able to see that and message us. 
We decided to use my Wordpress site, and I have taken on doing some admin work, mostly adding and setting up permissions for my teammates. 
Communicating more regularly is a goal for next week as we get closer to having to develop the site. 

Next steps include: 
•	Figuring out how to give real access to the site to my teammates so that they can edit it
•	Starting to consider updates to group/initial contracts for week 10
•	Potentially starting to map out the site and dividing responsibilities
