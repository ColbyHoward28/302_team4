For moduel 5, I would say that I can manage content using established workflows. This week it got more hands on with creating and getting ideas 
more up into the air, and I did not have a difficult time storing those Ideas to get ready to be put onto my teams website. I am able to manage everything that my 
group and I have that are ideas for our website and with using multiple sites to work through what we are doing as a team the content is still there and it does 
not get mixed with my workflow on any of the sites that we use.
