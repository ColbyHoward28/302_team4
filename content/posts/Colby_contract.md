An “A” website 

I Do everything I pledge to do and assigned to do and making sure my group have little to nothing to revise or change when I finish my part of the website and my assignment on the website. I think I would deserve and “A” if I stick to what has to be done and I do other things to help my group out on their part of their assignments as well because we are a team.

A “B” website…

Would be me doing everything I am expected to do for my group and the website but the work could be slightly better. Missing something minor in something that I do in what im assigned to do can contribute to my grade going from an A to a B. And lastly I think if I do not contribute to everything even more than what I was assigned to do I feel like my grade should be a B.


A “C” website…

I am assigned to editing, I feel like if I can’t meet all the criteria for editing and doing a good job at it and looks like it is just halfway work than I think I would deserve a C. Another thing that can contribute to a C would be not helping all of my group mates with their assigned roles as well as much as i could.

A “D” website…

This would be me doing the bare minimum and not having so much input and contribution on the website at all.


An “E” website…

Would be doing little to no work at all on the website. Not meeting my requirements of doing what im assigned to do. Not communicating with my groupmates about the work on my end not being completed, and me not really putting in any effort or creativity into the website or any of roles assigned throughout the course of building this website.
