For module 8 there was a lot of mistakes made due to pressing the wrong buttons and not understaning what was going on when it came to wordpress. I've never used nor heard of wordpress until this class so of course there are going to be mistakes when learning somthing new. With that I had to do some research of my own which makes me feel comfortable with the I can statement of "find and use resources for self-directed learning". I still have a lot of work to do when it comes to fully understanding how to use wordpress however im getting a better idea on what to do and where to look for information.
