For this week, I am more comfortatble with saying "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning". I was able to use wordpress this week and 
really dive into more of the editing process. When i was edting some of the pages I would ve assigned to it showed and taught me that there are many
ways of setting up your page and there are infinite ways to make your site look the way you want to. When using the tools it helped me get a better understanding
of chaning things around such ass color/contrast and even the little lines to outline your text boxes. It taught me alot !
