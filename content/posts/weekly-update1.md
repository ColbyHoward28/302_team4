This week as a group we figured out what type of website we want to design. We also came up with some cool ideas for the layout and what items or people we want to have on the front. We also talked about everyone's strength and weaknesses when it come to technology as well as group work. When it comes to communication we use Microsoft teams and it makes it easy for us to talk to each other whenever we have questions or ideas.
