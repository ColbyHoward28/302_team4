A work would look like:

I have contributed to both front and back-end aspects of the website. 
I commit to giving my teammates opportunities for feedback on content I make for the website. 
I have executed the tasks I have committed to or been assigned to. I have asked for help or extensions when needed. 
I have helped plan the layout and concept of the website, and worked hard on my contributions.

B work would look like: 

I have contributed to different parts of the website including site planning and implementation. 
I have generated content for the site but infrequently present it for feedback first. 
I have communicated with my teammates and asked for help or deadlines to be extended.

C work would look like: 

I have contributed to either planning or design of the website, but not significantly to both elements. 
I have not kept regularly to deadlines but have still completed some tasks. 
I have helped but not taken an active role in decision making.

D work would look like: 

I meet some deadlines but do not communicate when I need more time or am behind. 
Things are minimally optimized or reflect a lack of care.

E work would look like: 

Not following through on the tasks I have committed to do each week, not asking for feedback.
