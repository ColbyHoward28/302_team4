For this weeks module I can say that the statement "I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management" is the one that fits most for this weeks
module and for what I have done in class throughout the week. I am able to identify different blocks in wordpress to get them to be next to each otehr in a column 
or have it any other way and being felxible of where the blocks are placed in wordpress. I have learned from Dr. Greenhalgh too is which made me apply these key
concepts to my groups website and it has helped with workflow as well. It is a key concept to be able to structure blocks however you would like on wordpress to make
your website look unique.
