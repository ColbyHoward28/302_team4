This week, my learning was focused around the first I can statement and the concept of content aggregation. 
In our group, we started looking at the menu functions and how that would influence the structure of our site based on its theme. 
I think about content aggregation as how content is organized and how that organization influences the structure of the webpage.
I also continued working with WordPress for the Real Work project, identifying the cover function to potentially replicate the image behind text on the Contact page.
