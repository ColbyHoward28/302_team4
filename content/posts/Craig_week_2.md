During this week for module 2 I was able to post content files onto the Github website to be transfered onto our groups Netlify website. By creating a new file following the sample post and uploading our own content onto the Github website I am effectively showing my growth towards saying "I can manage content using established workflows". Content is something created through an editorial process for human consumption. While my post did not go through a sophisticated editorial processs, I still utilized editing processes like revising and spell check. When I have completley uploaded my post I will have effectively managed contento.
