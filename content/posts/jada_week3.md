This week we worked on our group contract and came up with some really cool ideas for our project. We also got to know each other alot better when talking about different classes we have in common. As well as getting to know each other and our contracts, we also had some articles that we read which gave us a better understanding of content creation. Im really excited to see how our final project turns out and everything we can create as a team.
