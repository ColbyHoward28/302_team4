This week, I want to focus on the statements: “I can identify and employ technologies related to content management” and “I can find and use resources for self-directed learning”.

My learning this week has mostly related to using Wordpress and starting to learn the language it uses. 
Last week, I was very intimidated by Wordpress but our real work session on Friday has helped me get more comfortable using the software.
I’ve started looking for articles and tutorials that explain the basic functions so that I can replicate the Contact Us page, as well as combing through the code of the Daybreak using the Inspect function. 
I have figured out that it is easier for me to start by sketching out what I think the structure of the page is, and then figuring out how to translate it into the page. 
Taking the time to look through different functions and elements in Wordpress is helping me get a better idea of the specific language it uses. 
Practicing patience has been key as well, so has focusing on the elements of the site that naturally interest me, like the colors or theme.
I’ve also started asking my teammates for help, which has also helped tremendously.
