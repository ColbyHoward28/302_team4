This week I want to center in on the statements "I can describe and compare content management systems" and "I can manage content using established workflows"
during class this weeks it was very easy for me to take any files and other metadata that we are using and putting into wordpress and also retrieving them through
another search engine and taking it downloading it and getting it onto wordpress and uploaded. I am able to Use and navigate the content management systems 
as well to make sure that I get everything done that needs to be done on the websites we work on and it has become easier after each week to impliment more things 
on to the websites we work on.
