This week I am more confident in describing and comparing content management systems. Becasue in week 6 it
has been really hands on with all the content managements websites we have been using in class while creating
or websites for our groups. I have been able to navigate wordpress and am able to manage lots of content that 
I am working with in there such as pictures and all sorts of other metadata. Along with editing different pages on a website.
