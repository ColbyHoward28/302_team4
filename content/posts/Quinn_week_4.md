This week I feel more confidant in making the statements: I can describe and compare content management systems and I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. 
In the interview we watched this week, Moore introduced us to several CMSs and also described several differences between them. 
He described tools like Wix and Squarespace as being less sophisticated and impressive tools for building websites and managing content and presented WordPress and similar tools as more robust and professionally relevant options. 
Our discussions of roles in content management also identified different ways people divide labor in doing content management. 
We identified roles like site planners, who handle things more on a design and mapping end, making a plan for where to go and how to start executing the vision.
