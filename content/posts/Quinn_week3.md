This week I feel more confidant making the statement “I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management” because of the discussions we had around commerce and content. 
The article on web comics discussed the different monetization models that web comics authors tried to make their content sustainable, which is something we described as a key part of content creation and management. 
A content creator has to consider how or if to make money off of the content they create and take the needs of a client or patron into consideration if they are funded by them. 
Similarly, people doing content management also need to meet the needs of their clients in order to sustain their own income or the clientele of the business they are part of.
