For this week as a group we started to come together and gear more towards what we will be 
doing individually. We have not had any problems with that and we also agreed to make sure we do 
a little bit of every job. So not only will one person just do editing but the whole group will 
have experience with each job that is available to do for our website. Overall we have a very good 
schedule together and we are moving at a good pace in starting to put our website ideas to reality.
