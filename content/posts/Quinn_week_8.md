This week my learning most relates to: “I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management”.

We talked a lot about the concept of presentation this week, and how it is useful to develop content separate from presentation when possible. 
The interview with Ms. Barton about the Kernel was particularly helpful as an example because the journalism students create the content (stories) which are then formatted and presented by the CMS, keeping the presentation uniform. 
I understand presentation to be more related to the aesthetic and layout choices that are made separately from the actual content. 
Content is ideally formatted based on the presentation and medium it appears in but can be adapted to different layouts without changing its underlying meaning.
