For this week’s PRL, I want to focus on the statement “I can manage content using established workflows”.

Over the last two weeks, I have been using my physical planner and the tasks tabs on my respective teams to make progress on the Daybreak Site and the record label site to create more guides for my contributions to both. 
I have also been communicating more with my teammates and I have found it easier now that the work is more broken up, or at least I have clear expectations for what I am doing. 
These workflows have helped me stay on tasks, creating the bios for all the artist pages, as well as create draft pages for 3 of the 4. 
I am behind on the current talent page, but what’s nice about the Teams workflows is that they can be updated and modified based on where the project is.
Workflows have helped keep me on track for creating content for my site, as well as organize the presentation decisions that still need to be made for it.

I have been learning how to use Teams better and also keep my teammates more updated on where I am in my work.
Establishing them was really important, as well as using a physical planner to keep track of the tasks/sketch out ideal layouts.
