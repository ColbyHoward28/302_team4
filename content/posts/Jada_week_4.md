This week I feel more confident in the statemnet "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management". When coming up with our personal contracts and jobs to give each other we had to do a little more research on specfic roles. I used the slides provided for us as well as google search. I have also gotten very comfortable using github as well as microsoft teams. We learned new ways to give each other reminders as well as different ways to plan. this week we also looked into scheduling things that we have to do as a group.
