This week we focused on creating the group contract and thinking about what the mission/objective of our record label is. 
We discussed the kinds of content we would need to create and put on the site and started looking at real websites with similar content. 
Some next steps include designing content for the site and planning and starting to build the site. 
We are still in a planning stage but getting a stronger idea of where we are trying to go.
