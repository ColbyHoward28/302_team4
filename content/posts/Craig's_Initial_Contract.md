An “A’ website 
An A for me would mean I committed to completing my tasks set out for me in a timely manner according with the rest of my group. I would like to be able to contribute to every aspect of our websites workflow as well as assist others as needed.
A “B” Website 
For me a B website would be I was able to complete my tasks, but it wasn’t in the most beneficial and effective way for the group. In the case of a B my time while working with the group would be spent off task.
A “C” Website
A C would be my work on the website is completed but is done in poor quality and shows lack of effort. It would also mean I was a hindrance on my groupmates and my efforts effected our workflow.
A “D” Website 
A D would be if I constantly relied on my groupmates to complete my tasks and I caused them to fall behind on tasks as well. For me a D means my low quality of work is poorly reflected on the website.
A “E” Website 
For an E I would have to show no effort in helping my group or completing my tasks. My lack of work would have cause other members of my group to complete my work and as a result we had a poor website.
