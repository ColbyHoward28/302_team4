This week during our group meeting, we made progress towards figuring out the specific layout we want for our website. We were successfully able to add menu tabs on our Hugo website for practice when we get to putting our website together. We didnâ€™t face any challenges throughout the week except for a few early struggles with adding menus. Following this week, we will have decided on our menu categories and their contents as well as planning out a main page.
