This week, I feel more confident making the statements: I can describe and compare content management systems and I can manage content using established workflows.
The two videos we watched this week introduced WordPress in more detail, describing it as an open-source CMS software that a good portion of sites on the web are constructed with. 
The interview from last module where WordPress was compared to other proprietary sites like Squarespace or drag and drops like Wix were also helpful in getting a better idea of why WordPress is as popular as it is. 
Alex’s definition of open-source (visible and changeable code) was particularly helpful because it explains the flexibility of WordPress, since it can technically be shaped and customized to the user’s specific wants. 
The Real-Work and Group work we did this week also got me thinking about managing and producing content, especially the conversations we had around dividing the work and administration. Although we haven’t set up specific tasks, having conversations and brainstorming sessions with my group and team has helped me get a better idea of our individual skillsets and communication styles. I’ve sketched out how I think the About/Contact pages are structured to try and visualize and plan different tasks to do.
