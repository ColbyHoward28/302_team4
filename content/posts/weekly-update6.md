This week as a group we learned how to create tabs on our website and also downloaded wordpress. As well as learning how to create tabs we figured out how to add folders to our github that combine with the tabs. We as a group worked together to solve and figured out problems as well as help each other out. We have also planned out what we want our website to display on the home page and how we would like to have it set up.
