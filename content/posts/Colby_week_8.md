For week 8 I can say that i can find and use resources for self-directed learning. This "I can" satement fits perfectly for what I have learned and did 
in last weeks classes. I was able to learn more about my building a website by just going through a bunch of trial and error on wordpress. Even though wordpress is
not the easiest to use I was able to learn more about how to get certain blocks to go nect to each other and getting text to form in a certain way. It was hard at first
but when you do trial and errory you get to figure things out and it all comes together like a puzzle. So for this week it was good to do work on wordpres and also
learn more about it at the same time.
