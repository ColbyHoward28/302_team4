This week our group worked on creating content for the site and doing some editing work.
First drafts of the majority of the artist pages have been made, and a logo/site header is still being developed.
The site needs more content, which is a goal of the next week as theme decisions are also made.
Workflows have helped organize some of the work that we are doing, dividing based on pages or a set of pages. 
The Current Talent page is behind, so that is something that will be focused on in the coming week as hopefully the site fleshes out.
