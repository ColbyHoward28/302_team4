Team 4 group contract:

An “A” website will.. 

Make the artist want to join our record label by going through our website and seeing the different ways we will help them excel in their music career. The content convinces an artist that our record label is the best for them and cares about their interests. Has a current talent page, links to social media, a contact page, promotional/featured content or merchandise, a mission/about page and a search function.


A “B” website  will….

    Competently shows that it is a record label and has some creative aspects. Demonstrates an understanding of the company and its goals,  but doesn’t fully accomplish them. Has a current talent page, links to social media, a contact page, a mission/about page and a search function.

A “C” website will…
    Functions mechanically but does not differentiate itself from other record labels. Does not look professional or intentional. Is not very persuasive. Has a current talent page, a contact page, a mission/about page and a search function.

A “D” website will…
    Be partially functional but still have significant flaws, resemble a record label in appearance but not content, not meet its mission of recruiting talent. Has an about page, a contact page, and few examples of current talent.

An “E” website will....
    Not be clearly identifiable as a record label, be nonfunctional as a web page, or be hard to navigate due to broken/missing links.
