During this week I was able to employ the statement “I can manage content using established workflows”. While working on the daybreak site I was using established workflows by determining what was left to be done of my groups page and assign tasks to see they get completed. Using a site like Microsoft teams makes it easy t assign tasks and communicate with group members to establish a workflow. Workflows are important when it comes to any group process as it makes sure tasks don’t get left out and are completed in order as to avoid any errors.
