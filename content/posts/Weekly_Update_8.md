For this week as a group we have been moving along our journey to setting up our record label website. We are starting to figure out a name for the record label 
website along with figuring out what content goes on each tab on your site. We have a solid foundation and vision for what we want our site to be and we are 
moving towards putting the vision to life by working together and starting to push more content onto our site.

This week we will have..

- Website name
- More Content under each tab
- solid theme for our website.
