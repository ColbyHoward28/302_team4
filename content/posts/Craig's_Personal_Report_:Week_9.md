 For this week’s “I can” statement I am able to identify and employ technologies related to content management systems. During this week I learned how different websites use content aggregation and the many ways it can be used. Content aggregation is useful in making websites easy to maneuver and content easier to locate. Using this knowledge, it will be helpful in determining how we show content aggregation in our group website. Looking at the different options afterwards I determined that menus and categories will be the most effective for our WordPress site.
