For week 11 I can say i meet the statement "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning". This statement fits best for this week because 
I was able to use wordpress and and some searching on google and I can compare from the two that there were certain things you can do on wordpress
that google can not help with and it forced me to use and leard wordpress more and navigating it more so that I can crack the code to an obstacle and then it helps
for the future. It is a big help with learning becasue some resources can be helpful and some may not but when I use my resources I am able to establish what will help
in what im doing and what will not and thats how I became more easy going on wordpress and using it.
