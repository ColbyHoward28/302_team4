This week was alot of fun and I feel a lot more comfortable in saying "I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management". In class we learned a lot of new tricks on Github. I was also able to describe certain aspects of github to one of our group members and felt very confident in the information I was giving. Once you learn how to do one thing on Github you dont want to stop learning somthing else to make the website look good and work awesome. We also joined some new groups and got to take a look at the dummy site which was very interesting and I cant wait to see how the whole class puts it together.
