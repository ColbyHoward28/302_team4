For this week I would say the satement "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management" this week in classes I made sure when working 
on my group projects I was able to manage content more than usual and give them their own sections by putting things in an organzied structured onto their own
assigned pages. Even when workng with my teammates we were all able to work together and I was able to manage and use their technologies along with mine to
become more organized with our work. I was able to identify and employ technologies and become more aware of how content is managed and distributed throughout 
the website(s).
