Week 9 has been very eventful. I feel very comfortable with the statement "I can manage content using established workflows". I say im very comfortable with this statement because as a group we were able to work through our website by first making a list of things we need to come up with, such as a name for the site, cover photos, content for each page and many more. I feel that as a group we work better with a list and each person having individual jobs and using established workflows helps us and me to do our roles better.
