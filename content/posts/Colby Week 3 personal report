For this week I feel like the statement "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning" is most relevant 
to what im learning and information that i collected during this weeks moduel. A big takeaway form this weeek is that
I started to realize that there is content everywhere and the ways to get content is through multiple resources. Through softwares is 
a resource that is most helpful when creating content and these resources can be used when me and my groups make our website in class.
I am looking forward to trying out different softwares to help create content.
