For week 2 of ICT 302 I feel that I am getting closer to being able to say “I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management”. This week while learning about github and netilify as well as microsoft teams I am getting comfortable with using these new programs that help with content management. Another statement that I can say is “I can identify and employ technologies related to content management”. I used github to post this response as well as our group response.
