This week was helpful for starting to become more comfortable with the statement “I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management”, especially with the terms content and audience. Last week when we defined content, two criteria were presented for considering something content: going through an editorial process and being intended for human consumption. The assigned interview and conversation we had with our second community partner took audience into consideration in very real ways and I found it very helpful to have examples of the kinds of groups these organizations considered an audience. Seeing the software that was used to create hold music helped me expand what I thought of as an editorial process. Thinking about mobile users as an audience was helpful too and reminded me that the intended audience of content may have needs related to technology or ability that can have real impacts on how that content is received.
