 This week our group really focused on separating work and editing our website. We had ourselves a team meeting to catch up on what needs to be done as well as to revise our group contract. Each of us has our own task that we want to get done before next Wednesday. The website doesn't have anything on it yet except for our pages however we are working on google docs and the information once finalized is going to get transferred over. Besides small technical issues our group is working well and the website is coming along.
