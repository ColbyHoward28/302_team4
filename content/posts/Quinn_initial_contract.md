*Ideally, I want to try my hand at all aspects of developing this website, we have decided to rotate through roles over the course of the semester. 

A work would look like:
I have contributed to both front and back-end aspects of the website. I commit to posting and updating drafts before changing major elements of the website. 
I have communicated consistently and executed the tasks I have committed to or been assigned. 
I have asked for help or extensions when needed but have kept mostly to the deadlines we set. 

B work would like:
I have contributed to different parts of the website including coding and design. 
I have generated content for the site but do not consistently present it for feedback first. 
I have communicated with my teammates and asked for help or deadlines to be extended. 

C work would look like:
I have contributed to either coding or design of the website, but not significantly to both elements. 
I have not kept regularly to deadlines but have communicated at least somewhat consistently. 
I have helped but not taken an active role in decision making.

D work would look like:
I meet some deadlines but do not communicate when I need more time or am behind. 
Things are minimally optimized or reflect a lack of care.

E work would look like: 
Not following through on the tasks I have committed to do each week, not communicating or including teammates in decision making. 
To me, an E would be either I donâ€™t do the work I have committed to do, or my teammates feel like I took over the project.
