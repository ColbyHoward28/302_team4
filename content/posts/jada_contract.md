Personal contact: Jada Little

With our group we have decided that instead of giving each person a specific role we would rotate jobs so that everyone gets the experience when it comes to hands on working to make our wordpress website the best it can be. The five jobs in context are editors, site planners, developers administrators, and stakeholders. Every Week when something is due or a job needs done we will rotate the roles/jobs. 


“A”
I will receive an “A” if my work is well done and on time. If  I do all my roles to the best of my abilities. Not only will I finish my work on time but I will communicate with my group on what needs to be done and if anyone needs help. 


“B”
All work is completed and on time but could be a little bit better. Communicates well with the team. 

“C”
Communication is lacking. Work is late and could be done better. Most of the work is turned in late. Not helping my group when they ask for it. 


“D”
Work is late and I do not contribute to group conversations in class. Communication is off. Work is turned in but is half done and sloppy. 


“E”
If I do not contribute to my team and our project I will give myself an “E”. If I hold my group back from doing the best they can do I will get an “E”. I lack communication tremendously as well as not trying on any jobs that are given to me.
