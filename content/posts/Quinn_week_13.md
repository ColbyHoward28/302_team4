This week provided me with more opportunities to feel confident in saying: “I can manage content using established workflows”.

In our group project, our team has been using Teams to communicate what parts of the website we are working on and where we are in our respective tasks.
I have used these workflows to guide my generation of content for the website, namely artist bios, and to help manage the remaining content I want to create.
Updating workflows has also given a sense of progression, and I am starting to move towards making presentation level decisions with more of the content created. 

I have also been exploring the features of the theme my group is using and deciding what built in features we want to use, with input in-class/over teams, to try and streamline the site and remove any unnecessary or unused default elements.
